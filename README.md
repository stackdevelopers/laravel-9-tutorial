Welcome to Laravel 9 Tutorial. In this tutorial, we are going to create a Multi Vendor Full-featured E-commerce Website in Laravel 9.

Laravel is one of the most popular PHP framework to develop websites. And recently, the Laravel 9 version has been launched that we will use for our Multi Vendor / Seller E-commerce Website.

Multi-vendor Portal or Website is a platform for third-party sellers to sell in one place. In simple terms, it is a big store that contains various small shops that are run by individual vendors.

E-Commerce websites like Amazon or eBay are good examples of multivendor websites where multiple vendors are allowed to register on a single platform with the same shopping cart and sell their products.

We are going to create such a kind of Multivendor website that can handle both B2B and B2C.

Multi-Vendor E-commerce Website is like a mall that contains many small shops and the responsibility of running each shop lies with the different individual shop owners. These small shops here in multi-vendor e-commerce websites are the vendor’s shops and the website is responsible for the order management, shipping management, and collecting payments.
